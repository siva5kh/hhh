# nw-distributed

This is a high-level role which includes other roles, for the purpose of configuring a NetWeaver or S4HANA distributed instance. This will normally be consumed by running the playbook `stacks/NetWeaver-Distributed/playbook.yml`, which also handles running Terraform to create machines and set up HANA.
