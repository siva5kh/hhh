# The toggle-lock-escalation script is a workaround for an issue with SAP on DB2 11.x
# that causes the following failure during PAS installation:
# "An error occurred during table depooling: Batch job SWPM_RUTPOADAPT terminated".
# For distributed and HA, this is done by the db2-lock-escalation role after sapinst
# has finished installing DB2, but for Standard this needs to run in the background to
# do the fix while sapinst is running.
