# NetWeaver-HA

This stack builds SAP application instances such as NetWeaver or S4HANA in HA mode, which includes a HANA HA instance.

# Prerequisites

## Infrastructure

If not using the provided Terraform, the following infrastructure components must exist.

### HANA

Two HANA machines are required, one for the primary and one for the secondary.

#### Disks

Two disks must be created and attached to each HANA machine.

`data` - This disk will contain three logical volumes, `data`, `shared`, and `log`.  Attach the disk to the machine with a [`device_name`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_attached_disk#device_name) of `data` to use the value Ansible uses for it by default. Changing this requires redefining the variable `sap_hana_disks`.

`backup` - The backup disk will have a single logical volume. Attach the disk to the machine with a `device_name` of `backup` to use the value Ansible uses for it by default.

### SCS

One ASCS machine is required.

One ERS machine is required.

#### Disks

Two disks must be created and attached to each SCS machine.

`usrsap` - This disk will contain one logical volume to be mounted on `/usr/sap`.  Attach the disk to the machine with a [`device_name`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_attached_disk#device_name) of `usrsap` to use the value Ansible uses for it by default.

`swap` - This disk will contain one logical volume to be used for swap.  Attach the disk to the machine with a [`device_name`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_attached_disk#device_name) of `swap` to use the value Ansible uses for it by default.

### Application servers

One PAS machine is required.

Zero or more AAS machines are required.

#### Disks

Two disks must be created and attached to each application server machine.

`usrsap` - This disk will contain one logical volume to be mounted on `/usr/sap`.  Attach the disk to the machine with a [`device_name`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_attached_disk#device_name) of `usrsap` to use the value Ansible uses for it by default.

`swap` - This disk will contain one logical volume to be used for swap.  Attach the disk to the machine with a [`device_name`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_attached_disk#device_name) of `swap` to use the value Ansible uses for it by default.

### NFS

SCS and application server machines will need access to NFS shares.

Option one is to create a single NFS share that is defined in the variable `sap_nw_nfs_src`. Subdirectories will be automatically created on it to use for all of the required mounts.

Option two is to create multiple NFS shares and use them individually in the variables `sap_nw_nfsvols_aas`, `sap_nw_nfsvols_pas`, and `sap_nw_nfsvols_scs`.

The NFS shares can be created with Cloud Filestore, NetApp, or by running `nfsd` on a GCE instance.

See [NFS Volumes](#nfs-volumes) for more details.

### Load balancers

There must be an internal load balancer (ILB) for HANA, one for ASCS, and when running Suse, one for ERS (RedHat uses an alias IP for ERS instead).

#### HANA

First, there must be one unmanaged instance group (UMIG) for the primary instance and one for the secondary instance.

The HANA ILB is then created with two backends: one whose group is the primary UMIG and another whose group is the secondary UMIG. The primary backend must have `failover` set to `false`, and the secondary backend must have `failover` set to `true`. The backends should have a [`failover_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_region_backend_service#failover_policy) with `disable_connection_drain_on_failover` set to `true`, `drop_traffic_if_unhealthy` set to `true`, and `failover_ratio` set to `1`.

#### ASCS

There must be a UMIG created for the ASCS instance.

The ASCS ILB is created with two backends: one whose group is the ASCS UMIG and another whose group is the ERS UMIG. The ASCS backend must have `failover` set to `false`, and the ERS backend must have `failover` set to `true`. The backends should have a [`failover_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_region_backend_service#failover_policy) with `disable_connection_drain_on_failover` set to `true`, `drop_traffic_if_unhealthy` set to `true`, and `failover_ratio` set to `1`.

#### ERS

There must be a UMIG created for the ERS instance (note this is true even for RedHat which does not use an ILB for ERS).

The ERS ILB is created with two backends: one whose group is the ASCS UMIG and another whose group is the ERS UMIG. These are the same UMIGs used for the ASCS ILB. The ERS backend must have `failover` set to `false`, and the ASCS backend must have `failover` set to `true`. The backends should have a [`failover_policy`](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/resources/compute_region_backend_service#failover_policy) with `disable_connection_drain_on_failover` set to `true`, `drop_traffic_if_unhealthy` set to `true`, and `failover_ratio` set to `1`.

### Alias IPs

If running RedHat, the ERS machine does not use an internal load balancer and will use an alias IP instead. Reserve an internal IP address whose value will be passed to Ansible via `sap_nw_ers_vip`, and Pacemaker will handle attaching the IP to the machine.

## Inventory

If using Terraform and Ansible together, the inventory is automatically generated. If using Ansible separately from or without Terraform, the inventory must be defined as shown.

### Inventory groups

The following inventory groups must be defined containing the hosts described below. You can choose your own names for the groups.

* HANA group
  * 1 Primary host
  * 1 Secondary host

* SAP application group
  * 1 ASCS host
  * 1 ERS host
  * 1 PAS host
  * 0 or more AAS hosts

### HANA inventory host variables

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| `sap_hana_is_primary` | Whether or not this is the primary host. | `bool` | n/a | yes |

### SAP application inventory host variables

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| `sap_is_ascs` | Whether or not this is the ASCS host. | `bool` | n/a | yes, on the ASCS host |
| `sap_is_ers` | Whether or not this is the ERS host. | `bool` | n/a | yes, on the ERS host |
| `sap_is_scs` | Whether or not this is an ASCS or ERS host. | `bool` | n/a | yes, on the ASCS and ERS hosts |
| `sap_is_pas` | Whether or not this is the PAS host. | `bool` | n/a | yes, on the PAS host |
| `sap_is_aas` | Whether or not this an AAS host. | `bool` | n/a | yes, on the AAS hosts |

### Examples

INI format:

```ini
# Note: when using INI formatted inventory, boolean inventory values
# must be in uppercase or Ansible will convert them to strings.

## NFS Volumes

The variables `sap_nw_nfsvols_aas`, `sap_nw_nfsvols_pas`, and `sap_nw_nfsvols_scs` are all lists of dictionaries. They have defaults which are defined if `sap_nw_nfs_src` is set, but for more control they can be set individually.

Each dictionary must be defined as follows:

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| `source` | The NFS server and share, for example `10.2.3.4:/sap`. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| `mountpoint` | The mount point. | `string` | n/a | yes |
| `mode` | The mode of the mount point. | `string` | `0755` | no |
| `owner` | The owner of the mount point. If the user will be created by the SAP installer, use the UID rather than the name, as the SAP installer will not have created the user before mounting the filesystem. | `string` | `root` | no |
| `group` | The group of the mount point. If the group will be created by the SAP installer, use the GID rather than the name, as the SAP installer will not have created the group before mounting the filesystem. | `string` | `root` | no |

Example:

```yaml
sap_nw_nfsvols_aas:
- source: 10.2.3.4:/sapmnt
  mountpoint: /sapmnt
- source: 10.6.7.8:/usrsaptrans
  mountpoint: /usr/sap/trans
  owner: '2001'
  group: '2000'
  mode: '0750'
```
