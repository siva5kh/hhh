# Install Media

Before running the automation, SAP install media needs to be uploaded to the buckets defined in `sap_hana_install_files_bucket` and `sap_nw_install_files_bucket` (these can be the same bucket). The [gsutil](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/gsutil) tool can be used to populate the buckets with the media according to the instructions below.

## HANA Install Media

HANA install media needs to be uploaded to the buckets defined in `sap_hana_install_files_bucket`.

### HANA Version 20SPS03

All files should be uploaded `sap_hana_install_files_bucket` with the prefix `HANA/20SPS03`

HANA 2.0 SPS03 installs from EXE/RAR files. The RAR file version may differ, depending on your patch level.

`HANA/20SPS03/51053061_part1.exe`

`HANA/20SPS03/51053061_part2.rar`

`HANA/20SPS03/51053061_part3.rar`

`HANA/20SPS03/51053061_part4.rar`

The SAPCAR command for linux x86_64 must be uploaded:

`HANA/20SPS03/SAPCAR_1320-80000935.EXE`

The SAP host agent RPM must be uploaded:

`HANA/20SPS03/saphostagentrpm_44-20009394.rpm`

Optionally, a SAR file containing an upgrade may be uploaded. If it is present, the upgrade will be run, otherwise it is skipped.

`HANA/20SPS03/IMDB_SERVER20_037_1-80002031.SAR`

### HANA Version 20SPS04 and later

All files should be uploaded into `sap_hana_install_files_bucket` with the prefix `HANA/20SPS04`

HANA 2.0 SPS04 and later install from ZIP files. The ZIP file version may differ according to version and patch level. The value of `<version>` may be `20SPS04` or `20SPS05`, for example.

`HANA/<version>/51053787.ZIP`

The SAPCAR command for linux x86_64 must be uploaded:

`HANA/<version>/SAPCAR_1320-80000935.EXE`

The SAP host agent RPM must be uploaded:

`HANA/<version>/saphostagentrpm_44-20009394.rpm`

Optionally, a SAR file containing an upgrade may be uploaded. If it is present, the upgrade will be run, otherwise it is skipped.

`HANA/<version>/IMDB_SERVER20_048_2-80002031.SAR`
