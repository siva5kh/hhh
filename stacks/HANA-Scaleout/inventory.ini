# This example inventory file in INI format is only for use with
# playbook-notf.yml. When running playbook.yml, you do not need to supply
# an inventory as it is generated automatically from Terraform outupts.

# Note: when using INI formatted inventory, boolean inventory values
# must be in uppercase or Ansible will convert them to strings.

# The host group names must be changed in the playbook if changed here.
# Change hostnames (the first field) below to suit your environment.
# Additional variables may be added to individual hosts if required,
# such as `ansible_user`, but do not remove the existing host variables.

# HANA host group combines master and worker host groups.
