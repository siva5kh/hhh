# NetWeaver-Standard

This stack builds a NetWeaver or S4HANA Standard instance, including HANA Scaleup.

# Deployment Architecture

![NetWeaver-Standard](./images/standard.png)

# Requirements

Python 3 is required.

# Usage

See the README at the root of the repository for instructions common to all stacks.

## Deploying the stack

Copy stacks/NetWeaver-Standard/vars/deploy-vars.yml and populate it with the variables as described below.

From the root of the repository, run:

```
./ansible-wrapper stacks/NetWeaver-Standard/playbook.yml -e @vars.yml
```

## Destroying the stack

Use the same command as for deploying, but add the `state: absent` variable:

```
./ansible-wrapper stacks/NetWeaver-Standard/playbook.yml -e @vars.yml -e state=absent
```

# Variables

`sap_hana_instance_name`: (Required) - Name of HANA instance.

`sap_hana_install_files_bucket`: (Required) - Bucket where HANA installation files are located.

`sap_hana_instance_number`: (Optional, default `00`) - Instance number for HANA. This is a two digit number, but must be in quotes, or it may get converted into single digits, for example `00` without surrounding quotes gets converted to the number `0`.

`sap_hana_instance_type`: (Optional, default `n1-highmem-32`) - The GCE instance type for HANA. Must be one of `n1-highmem-32`, `n1-highmem-64`, `n1-highmem-96`, `n2-highmem-32`, `n2-highmem-48`, `n2-highmem-64`, `n2-highmem-80`, `m1-megamem-96`, `m1-ultramem-40`, `m1-ultramem-80`, `m1-ultramem-160`, `m2-ultramem-208`, or `m2-ultramem-416`.

`sap_hana_password`: (Required) - The password for HANA.

`sap_hana_product_version`: (Optional, default `20SPS03`) - The version of HANA. Must be one of `20SPS03` or `20SPS04`.

`sap_hana_service_account_name`: (Optional, default `sap-common-sa`) - The name of the service account assigned to HANA instances. This should not be a full service account email, just the name before the `@` symbol.

`sap_hana_sid`: (Required) - The System ID for HANA. This is a three character uppercase string which may include digits but must start with a letter.

`sap_nw_instance_type`: (Optional, default `n1-standard-8`) - The GCE instance type for NetWeaver or S4HANA instances.

`sap_nw_install_files_bucket`: (Required) - Bucket where NetWeaver or S4HANA installation files are located.

`sap_nw_instance_name`: (Required) - Name of application instance.

`sap_nw_password`: (Required) - The password for NetWeaver or S4HANA.

`sap_nw_product`: (Optional, default `NetWeaver`) - The SAP product, must be one of `NetWeaver` or `S4HANA`.

`sap_nw_product_version`: (Optional, default `750`) - The SAP product version. If `sap_nw_product` is `NetWeaver` it must be `750`, if `sap_nw_product` is `S4HANA` it must be `1709` or `1809`.

`sap_nw_service_account_name`: (Optional, default `sap-common-sa`) - The name of the service account assigned to NetWeaver or S4HANA instances. This should not be a full service account email, just the name before the `@` symbol.

`sap_nw_sid`: (Required) - The System ID for NetWeaver or S4HANA. This is a three character uppercase string which may include digits but must start with a letter.

`sap_project_id`: (Required) - The project ID where instances are located.

`sap_source_image_family`: (Required) - The source image family for machines.

`sap_source_image_project`: (Required) - The project for the source image. Official SAP images are from `rhel-sap-cloud` for RedHat or `suse-sap-cloud` for Suse.

`sap_nw_subnetwork`: (Required) - The name of the subnetwork used for machines and load balancers.

`sap_subnetwork_project_id`: (Optional, default `''`) - The name of the subnetwork project, if using a shared VPC. If not given, `sap_project_id` will be used.

`sap_tf_state_bucket`: (Required) - The GCS bucket where Terraform state is stored. If it does not exist, it will be created. Note that the name must be unique, as there can only be one bucket with a given name (it gets a global DNS name). If there is a permissions error when creating this bucket, it is likely that one already exists in another project with the same name.

`sap_tf_state_bucket_prefix`: (Required) - This is the prefix for the Terraform state within the bucket defined in `sap_tf_state_bucket`. This should be unique for each instance of a stack, or there will be conflicts between resources. For example, if creating more than one `NetWeaver-HA` stack, give each one its own `sap_tf_state_bucket_prefix`.

`sap_zone`: (Required) - The zone where all resources are created.
